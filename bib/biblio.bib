This laser displays complex dynamical behavior, including deterministic chaos, in two different regimes. The extreme value pulses are observed in the chaotic state of only one of these two regimes. The observations agree with the predictions of a well-tested theoretical model that does not include noise or self-Q-switching into its framework. This implies that, in this laser, the extreme effects have a nontrivial dynamical origin. The Ti:sapphire laser is hence revealed as a new and convenient system for the study of these effects.},

	abstract = {Semiconductor lasers with continuous-wave optical injection display a rich variety of behaviors, including stable locking, periodic or chaotic oscillations, excitable pulses, etc. Within the chaotic regime it has been shown that the laser intensity can display extreme pulses, which have been identified as optical rogue waves (RWs), and it has also been shown that such extreme pulses can be completely suppressed via direct modulation of the laser current, with appropriated modulation amplitude and frequency. Here we perform a numerical analysis of the RW statistics and show that, when RWs are not suppressed by current modulation, their probability of occurrence strongly depends on the phase of the modulation. If the modulation is slow (the modulation frequency, fmod, is below the relaxation oscillation frequency, fro), the RWs occur within a well-defined interval of values of the modulation phase, i.e., there is a ``safe'' window of phases where no RWs occur. The most extreme RWs occur for modulation phases that are at the boundary of the safe window. When the modulation is fast (fmod \&gt; fro), there is no safe phase window; however, the RWs are likely to occur at particular values of the modulation phase. Our findings are of interest for the study of RWs in other systems, where a similar response to external forcing could be observed, and we hope that they will motivate experimental investigations to further elucidate the role of the modulation phase in the likelihood of the occurrence of RWs.},

The term 'optical rogue wave' was first used in the context of an analogy between pulse propagation in an optical fibre and wave group propagation on deep water, but has since been generalized to describe many other processes in optics. This Review provides an overview of the field, concentrating primarily on propagation in optical fibre systems that exhibit nonlinear breather and soliton dynamics, but also discussing other optical systems in which extreme events have been reported. Although statistical features such as long-tailed probability distributions are often considered to be the defining feature of rogue waves, we emphasize the underlying physical processes that drive the appearance of extreme optical structures.},
